# matasano crypto challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xfbs/matasano.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xfbs/matasano)

this is my attempt at solving the challenge using rust, to both
learn more about rust and crypto.

see the [website](http://cryptopals.com/) for more information.

## solutions

 -  [set 1](set1/)

## building and testing

there are makefiles which will try to
build all of the solutions, and they
can test then as well.

```bash
make build
make test
```
